EcoEats
Intelligent Food Inventory & Sustainability Management System

Aligned with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)

1. Project Overview

EcoEats is a cloud-based intelligent food management system designed to reduce household food waste while promoting balanced and mindful consumption habits. The application enables users to digitally manage groceries, track expiration dates, and receive recipe recommendations that prioritize ingredients nearing expiry.

Food waste is a major contributor to environmental degradation and inefficient resource consumption. Simultaneously, individuals often struggle with organizing groceries and planning meals efficiently. EcoEats addresses these issues by integrating real-time inventory tracking with algorithm-driven recommendation logic.

This project supports:

SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production
By reducing avoidable household food waste through proactive expiry tracking.

SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being
By supporting balanced meal planning and dietary awareness.
Important clarification: EcoEats does not provide medical advice, pharmaceutical reminders, or any form of medical notification system.

2. Technical Implementation Overview

EcoEats is developed using a modern, scalable, serverless architecture powered primarily by Google Cloud technologies.

2.1 Technology Stack

Frontend

Web-based user interface (built with modern JavaScript framework)

Responsive design for cross-device usability

Backend (Google Technologies)

Firebase Authentication – Secure user login and identity management

Cloud Firestore – Real-time NoSQL cloud database

Firebase Cloud Functions – Event-driven backend logic

Firebase Hosting – Secure and scalable web hosting

Firebase Cloud Messaging – Expiry notification system

2.2 Architecture Design

EcoEats follows a serverless, event-driven architecture:

Users input grocery items (manual entry or barcode scanning).

Data is stored in Cloud Firestore.

Cloud Functions trigger automated processes:

Expiry date monitoring

Notification scheduling

Recipe recommendation ranking

The frontend retrieves updated data in real time.

Users receive prioritized suggestions and alerts.

Because the system avoids reliance on local device storage and operates fully in the cloud, it supports:

Real-time synchronization

Cross-device access

Secure centralized data management

Automatic scaling with increased traffic

3. Implementation Details
3.1 Grocery Input System

Users can:

Manually enter grocery items

Use barcode scanning for faster data entry

Automatically populate item names through database lookup

This system reduces user friction and improves usability efficiency.

3.2 Expiry Priority Logic

To enhance clarity and urgency recognition, EcoEats implements a color-coded priority system:

Red – Expires within 2 days

Yellow – Expires within 5 days

Green – Fresh items

This visual classification simplifies decision-making and encourages timely consumption.

3.3 Expiry-Based Recommendation Algorithm

The core innovation lies in the recommendation engine. Unlike conventional recipe platforms, EcoEats ranks recipes based on:

Expiry proximity of ingredients

Ingredient availability

User-defined dietary preferences

The algorithm prioritizes recipes that maximize the usage of soon-to-expire items while maintaining balanced meal composition. This approach integrates sustainability logic directly into the food selection process.

4. Innovation

EcoEats introduces several innovative elements:

4.1 Sustainability-First Recommendation Model

Rather than focusing solely on user taste preference, the system prioritizes waste reduction through expiry-driven ranking logic.

4.2 Real-Time Cloud Lifecycle Tracking

Using Firestore and Cloud Functions, food lifecycle events are monitored dynamically without requiring manual updates.

4.3 Serverless Scalable Design

The use of Firebase services eliminates infrastructure management overhead while ensuring reliability and elasticity.

4.4 User-Centered Iterative Refinement

The system was refined through structured user testing and measurable improvements based on feedback.

5. User Testing and Iteration
5.1 Testing Overview

12 external users (outside the development team)

5 university students

4 working adults

3 household family users

Testing duration: 7 days

Users were instructed to:

Input real groceries

Monitor expiry notifications

Use recipe suggestions

5.2 Key Feedback and Improvements

Feedback 1: Manual entry required too much time.
→ Implemented barcode scanning and auto-fill database.
→ Achieved approximately 40% reduction in input time.

Feedback 2: Expiry urgency was not visually clear.
→ Introduced color-coded priority system.
→ Improved clarity and faster decision-making.

Feedback 3: Recipes should prioritize expiring ingredients.
→ Refined ranking algorithm to emphasize expiry proximity.
→ Increased user satisfaction and perceived usefulness.

This structured iteration demonstrates systematic improvement based on real user behavior.

6. Scalability and Future Expansion
6.1 Scalability

EcoEats is built on a serverless architecture:

Firebase automatically scales infrastructure

Cloud Functions expand with user-triggered events

Firestore supports horizontal data scaling

With minimal modification, the system can:

Support multi-country deployment

Enable multilingual interfaces

Handle thousands of concurrent users

Integrate external APIs (e.g., retailers)

6.2 Planned Future Features

AI-based grocery image recognition

Integration with grocery retailers (digital receipt sync)

Community food-sharing network

Smart auto-generated shopping lists

Carbon footprint impact dashboard

These enhancements aim to expand EcoEats into a comprehensive sustainability intelligence platform.

7. Challenges Faced
7.1 Usability vs. Data Accuracy

Balancing detailed tracking with user convenience required iterative interface simplification.

7.2 Algorithm Optimization

Designing a ranking system that balances expiry urgency and dietary preferences required logical refinement and performance testing.

7.3 Real-Time Event Management

Efficient notification scheduling without excessive triggers required careful Cloud Function configuration.

These challenges strengthened the system’s robustness and scalability.

8. Conclusion

EcoEats demonstrates how cloud-native technologies and intelligent algorithm design can address real-world sustainability challenges. By combining food lifecycle tracking, expiry-driven recommendations, and scalable Google Cloud infrastructure, the system provides a practical and measurable solution for reducing household food waste.

The project reflects strong integration between technical implementation, innovation, user-centered design, and global sustainability objectives.
